So did you really do the project for Prof. Yanif Ahmad?
So did YOU really do the project for Prof. Yanif Ahmad?
So was Prof. Yanif Ahmad's research as easy as CS 101 projects at Johns Hopkins?

Prof. Yanif Ahmad can answer these questions, I can't. Because from my perspective, it was a miracle. And miracle is a mystery which cannot be explained.

God: "All you need to do is to ask. Ask, and it shall be given you. The pharaoh and his court did not believe at the first time. They will come round."

Don't try this at home, in case you end up like me or [Terry](http://www.templeos.org/). But allow me to proudly present you...

# UltraViolet

*A very crude imitation of God's perfect idea*
*that resolves trivial bickering by seeking consensus among men*
*and brings His peace to the world*

## Name

The name of the project is a reference to the heroine of the anime [Violet Evergarden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violet_Evergarden).

If you are or have once been a student of physics, you would know that UV light is a type of invisible electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength range of 10-400nm. One of its many uses is to sterilize, or in other words, kill germs.

## Technical Notes

UltraViolet employs [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)/[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) to store structured data. The [Scrapy framework](https://scrapy.org/) can power pluggable spiders to collect contact information of members of the targeted community from the Internet. The application then uses the information to personalize [Markdown-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) email templates and send unsolicited emails via [standard protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol). The recipients, should they choose to respond, can visit a [secure site](https://wordpress.com/) via an embedded link and freely express their opinions. It also does a bit data mining and knowledge discovery, while driving a showy pseudo real-time interactive dashboard (WTF!).

The deployment of the application is streamlined thanks to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). The programming languages to be used are [python](https://www.python.org/) and [PHP](http://www.php.net/). Besides God's help, it is obvious that I could employ [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to write a better program. I have yet to figure out how to do I&T, coverage, CI, etc.

Sounds great! But I can assure you I have never done something remotely like this in the past 32 years of my life. I mean who ever did?

## Privacy & Fair Data Usage

No personally identifiable information collected will be released or transferred to any third party, unless the Chinese government suddenly wants to put me behind bars (I would estimate a chance of less than one in a thousand, so you should feel very safe). All data and backups (except for those who do not require anonymity) will be permanently erased after I get what I want.

I use industry standard practices like [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) (kudos to [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)) and [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) to protect data submission and transfer. My servers in Singapore and China have been up and running without incidence for years and I intend to keep them that way in the years to come. The Singapore server is somewhat expendable, so all crucial stuff eventually goes to China.

## License & Services

[MIT](https://github.com/aadps/ultraviolet/blob/master/LICENSE), as God's gifts are always free.

However, a good shrink is not, even in Beijing. So should you require any technical consulting related to this project, I am just an [email](mailto:admin@aadps.net) away. My services include but are not limited to:

* Customize web spider
* Draft email template
* Design form/dashboard
* Software-as-a-Service (read: you take care of server(s), I take care of everything else)
* Platform-as-a-Service (read: I take care of everything)

The rate is cheaper than any decent lawyer, and there are discounts for students, teachers, professors, servicemen and their families (veterans, police officers, firefighters, etc.), pro-bono legal counsels for old times' sake. Describe your problem and needs (budget or bid is optional, but welcome) and I will give you a quote. I will not judge you as long as you do not judge me, even if you are running for the treasurer of local HOA:)

(For the HOA remark, I mean do people actually do this?)

## Chances

Peak values at 40% and 5%, not a big deal, really.
